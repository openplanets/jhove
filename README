JHOVE
=====

This is a small project to take the JHOVE source code and Mavenise it, so that snapshots and official releases 
can be published.

The codebase has been very slightly patched, in JhoveBase, so that JHove will pick up a config file from inside 
the main JAR if non is supplied. This allows JHove to be run as a standalone JAR.
